There are a ton of options for building your own website and blog out there which can make it hard to figure out where to start. I used the following technology to setup my portfolio website and blog for free:

* GitHub Pages
* Cloudflare
* Jekyll
* Forestry
* Google Domains*

\*The only thing I am paying for is a custom domain name, which is not a necessary step at all.
